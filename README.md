# HOLLOW_ROOM_DEMO
This repository contains the early demo of my game.
It’s still incomplete, but open to continuous updates and expansion. The core premise is a dating-sim-style experience where your choices shape the ending. The game features hidden affection meters, an insanity meter, branching paths, and a main character surrounded by four potential romance options. It is only the beginning — and it will keep growing as I develop it further.
